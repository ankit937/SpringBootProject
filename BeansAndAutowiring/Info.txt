Beans can be created with the help of @Beans and @Component
@Beans - Should be declared in Config file with @Configuration annotation
@Component - Class level annotation, no need to specify @Beans annotation when using @Component
           - In Config file, @Configuration need to be added along with that @ComponentScan need to be added to search for @Component present in packages.

Autowiring is done in 3 ways:
Construtor based, Setter based, class filed based.
